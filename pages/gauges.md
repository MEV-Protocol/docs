# Gauges
As mentioned in protocol overview, in order to get an active gauge, a token requires whitelisting. Partners will all have various gauges for the tokens of their ecosystems on a token by token based consideration. Other "core" tokens (wETH, wBTC...) may also have gauges setup at the discretion of the team. 


# Future Partners

At Genesis, we have whitelisted our genesis partners, however we do hold in reserve `veFLOW` NFTs for future partner protocols. Negotiations with potential projects will distinguish how they can get an veNFT. That being said, some ideas of the type of requirement for future partners would be:

* a requirement to bribe some gauges, their own or core.
* a token swap
* integrations
* marketing campaigns


# Future Gauges
On the Velocimeter road map some ideas to introduce new gauge types exist. At this time, we are not ready to share any of them, but will if and when new code is ready.

## Who Bribes

In most cases, a partner project will be the entity that is bribing. However, this doesn't have to be the case. Any user that wishes can create a bribe to incentivize the voting for any pair that has a gauge. 
Velocimeter will even use a portion of their `FLOW` earned every week to bribe select pools.


## Claiming
Once an epoch flips, any bribe that are owed to a voter, are immediately claimable. To claim simply goto the [Rewards page](https://www.velocimeter.xyz/rewards), select the NFT that voted, and the bribes will immediately show up as claimable.

# Auto Bribe
To make bribing more easy for projects, they can request an autoBribe contract to be created. A project can fill up these contracts with a variety of bribe tokens of differing quantities, and set an amount of weeks
to divide these bribes up into. This give them a temporary set and forget system for bribing.

## Distributing the Bribes
Any chain to a blockchain required that gas is spent and a transaction is called. There are not automatic changes. Usually these sort of needs are dealt with by bots (aka keepers) that have gas money and call functions
for projects at some set times. 

With the autoBribe contracts, instead, we decided to give this opportunity to the community. On the [Bribe page](https://www.velocimeter.xyz/bribe), you will find a series of buttons. On a weekly basis, these buttons will become active for the community to call and send project bribes. To compensate individually that successfully call these function. 0.5% of the bribe amount will be gifted to the caller.

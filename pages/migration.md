## Migration Steps

### Migration Timeline

Migration will be announced in Discord and on Twitter. 

### veFLOW 
*  Nothing. veFLOW was airdropped.

### FLOWv1 -> FLOWv2 
*  Collect up your FLOWv1 from claiming from gauges.
*  Collect up your FLOWv1 from dismantling any FLOW liquidity you have provided.
*  Go to the REDEEM tab on the site and follow the simple 1 way swap. This should be done within 1 week. Any FLOWv1 that is not redeemed before the next epoch flip will not be able to be redeemable. This is because it’s not possible to turn off the V1 contracts and it’s still possible for these contracts to continue to be farmed. 

### Add Liquidity
- After converting your FLOWv1 to FLOWv2, those that want to addLiquidity to FLOW pairs on v2 are encouraged to do so.
5M FLOW tokens will be used to create new veFLOW and given prorata to people that create FLOW:wCANTO, FLOW:NOTE pairs



### Migration Guide

v1 UI: Used for claiming rewards and withdrawing liquidity https://canto.velocimeter.xyz

Use v1 UI to fully unstake and withdraw from all pools. Your LP tokens should go back to single assets (v1 LP tokens and v2 LP tokens are not compatible.)

v2 UI: Used for adding liquidity - https://velocimeter.xyz

Adding liquidity in V2 is the same process.

#### Out of the Shoals
Im a big fan of movies like Master and Commander, and Pirates of the Caribbean.
I can help but feel like those captains that wake up to danger.
Usually it’s the case of an attack, but in this cause I consider it more like drifting into shoals. 
This process was to say the least stressful, but we have come through it.
I foresee smooth sailing from here on, and soon we will all find ourselves safely anchored outside our favorite port city.

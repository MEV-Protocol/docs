  As with any launch, we want to warn users that this product is in beta. Users should use at their own risk. We also recommend that you interact with the site in **desktop environments**.
  
  If at any point you require assistance, please join our
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/qpue2s6VfJ), where there are many degens that will be more than happy to help you so you can pamp their bags.


## Getting Ready

Velocimeter operates on the Canto.

To set up your wallet, please go to https://chainlist.org and search for _Canto_.
You can use the _Connect Wallet_ button to automatically configure
your default wallet to use Canto. Use the _arrow down_ to expand for more
configuration options.


## Bridging
New Canto users will need to have `$CANTO` on Canto to pay gas transaction fees. 
Bridging to Canto can be done on [Canto Bridge](https://canto.io/bridge), [Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com/) or [Gravity](https://www.gravitybridge.net/).



  Some bridging services can take up to 20-30 minutes to complete a transfer of
  the assets. Velocimeter doesn't guarantee the results of any of the bridges. Issue with bridges 
  are best taken up with the respective communities of those bridges.


### Initial Distribution

On Canto, the initial supply was 630M FLOW tokens, most of which were locked for four years to be granted to partners, early investors, and community members.


Details of the initial distribution and token emissinos are available in the
[Initial Distribution section of the Tokenomics](/tokenomics#initial-distribution).

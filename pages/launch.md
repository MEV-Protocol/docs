# Launch Details

Velodrome is launching on Tuesday, May 31th 2022!

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  As with any launch, we'd like to warn our users about the potential limitations
  of the first release. At launch, our dApp will render best in
  **desktop environments**.

  We anticipate having a mobile-optimized version of the dApp in future
  updates. Other functionality might not be fully optimized (e.g., error
  messages).

  If at any point you require assistance, please join our
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/bqzYruhX), where our community and we will be
  happy to help you!

  Thank you in advance for your patience as we work to deliver a flawless and
  beautiful product.
</Callout>

## Getting Ready

Velodrome Finance operates exclusively on the Optimism network (a
layer 2 of the Ethereum main network that uses Optimistic Rollups).

If you are unfamiliar with Optimism, you can find a lot of resources
about the network, its ecosystem, and its mission on the Optimism website
https://www.optimism.io

To set up your wallet, please go to https://chainlist.org and search for
_Optimism_. You can use the _Connect Wallet_ button to automatically configure
your default wallet to use Optimism. Use the _arrow down_ to expand for more
configuration options.

<Callout  emoji="🪂">
  Be sure to learn about the [Optimism
  Collective](https://app.optimism.io/governance) and see if you qualify for an
  OP token airdrop!
</Callout>

## Bridging

New Optimism users who want to participate in Velodrome should make sure they
have `$ETH` on Optimism in order to be able to pay for transaction/gas fees.

Bridging to Optimism is possible here: https://app.optimism.io/bridge

If you're bridging from a network other than the Ethereum network, we recommend the
following services:
* https://stargate.finance/transfer &mdash; a multi-network bridge for stable
   coins
* https://www.bungee.exchange &mdash; an aggregator that shows the best
   available bridging options. Use their _Refuel_ service to deposit smaller
   amounts in case you run out of `$ETH` to pay transaction fees.
 * https://www.optimism.io/apps/bridges &mdash; for a full list of Optimism
   network bridging services.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Some bridging services can take up to 20-30 minutes to complete a transfer of
  the assets.

Here's a walkthrough for how to use the Optimism Bridge on mobile:

## A message to the veDAO community

The members of the veDAO core team learned a tremendous amount about `ve(3,3)`
mechanics after receiving the 4th largest `$veNFT` in what's come to be called the
_Solidly Wars_.

This experience resulted in a veDAO governance proposal, which passed, directing the
team to seek opportunities outside of accruing Solidly vote share on the Fantom
network.

The veDAO core team incubated Velodrome in accordance with DAO
governance principles for the benefit of the DAO. veDAO's final governance act was to make
good on this promise, distributing accumulated treasury in `$USDC` and `$VELO`
tokens to `$WEVE` holders.

The veDAO community stuck with us through a seemingly impossible number of
surprises, challenges, and disappointments. They're friends, allies, and, in
some cases, central team members. Everything we do with Velodrome from here is
rooted in our shared experience.

We believe that the veDAO members will be valuable, enthusiastic additions to
the Optimism community in the coming weeks and will be instrumental in the long-term
success of Velodrome.

### Burning `$WEVE`

The redemption process uses [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) for a
seamless experience. The process will burn user-provided `$WEVE` tokens on the
Fantom network and will send `$USDC` and `$VELO` on the Optimism network.

The tokens will be sent to the same address, as with any bridging experience.

The `$WEVE` bridging service will be available at https://weve.velodrome.finance
on May 31st and will be available until the 30th of June. Unclaimed `$USDC` and `$VELO` will
be transferred back into the treasury.

### Initial Distribution

Velodrome will launch with initial distribution of 400M VELO airdropped to
DeFi community members, protocols, and DAOs likeliest to play an active role in the Optimism
ecosystem.

Details of the initial distribution and token emissinos are available in the
[Initial Distribution section of the Tokenomics](/tokenomics#initial-distribution).

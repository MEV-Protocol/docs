Velocimeter launched on Thursday, June 2, 2022.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  As with any launch, we'd like to warn our users about the potential limitations
  of the first release. At launch, our dApp will render best in
  **desktop environments**.
  
  If at any point you require assistance, please join our
  [Discord](), where our community and we will be
  happy to help you!
</Callout>

## Getting Ready

Velocimeter operates exclusively on the Arbitrum network.

If you are unfamiliar with Arbitrum, you can find a lot of resources
about the network, its ecosystem, and its mission on the Arbitrum website
https://www.Arbitrum.io

To set up your wallet, please go to https://chainlist.org and search for
_Arbitrum_. You can use the _Connect Wallet_ button to automatically configure
your default wallet to use Arbitrum. Use the _arrow down_ to expand for more
configuration options.



## Bridging

New Arbitrum users who want to participate in Velocimeter should make sure they
have `$ETH` on Arbitrum in order to be able to pay for transaction/gas fees.

Bridging to Arbitrum is possible here: https://app.Arbitrum.io/bridge

If you're bridging from a network other than the Ethereum network, we recommend the
following services:
* https://stargate.finance/transfer &mdash; a multi-network bridge for stable
   coins
* https://www.bungee.exchange &mdash; an aggregator that shows the best
   available bridging options. Use their _Refuel_ service to deposit smaller
   amounts in case you run out of `$ETH` to pay transaction fees.
 * https://www.Arbitrum.io/apps/bridges &mdash; for a full list of Arbitrum
   network bridging services.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Some bridging services can take up to 20-30 minutes to complete a transfer of
  the assets.

Here's a walkthrough for how to use the Arbitrum Bridge on mobile:

# About

Velodrome Finance is an automated market maker (AMM) on
[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) L2 blockchain.

Velodrome Finance inherits standard features popularized by Uniswap V2, but
was designed to:
 * have a small trading fee, only 0.022%
 * use the generated fees in order to incentivize the liquidity providers
 * offer near zero slippage on uncorrelated or tightly correlated digital
   assets
 * route trades through stable and volatile asset pairs
 * provide no-upkeep, flashloan-proof, 30 minute time-weighted average price
   (TWAP) with direct quoting support

## Who is behind this project?

The team behind Velodrome Finance previously launched
[VeDAO](https://twitter.com/_vedao_), an initiative from [IT
DAO](https://informationtoken.io), with the mission to support the Solidly
ecosystem, a protocol launched on Fantom by Andre Cronje and his team, while
driving long-term value to the VeDAO community.

Since then, VeDAO team has developed deep subject matter expertise on both
Solidly and `ve(3,3)` mechanisms, becoming the go-to resource for protocols and
chains seeking support around these topics.

In numbers, VeDAO, managed to attract $2.6B in TVL in the early days, securing
~10% of the Solidly voting power and ~$1.1M USDC in its treasury.

## What is our mission?

Our mission is to make Velodrome Finance a public good and the liquidity base
layer of the Optimism ecosystem.

## How is this different from other protocols?

Velodrome Finance as a product, is inspired and built upon the good parts of
the protocols like [Solidly](https://github.com/solidlyexchange),
[Curve](https://curve.fi/rootfaq), [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com),
[Votium](https://votium.app) and [Llama
Airforce Union](https://llama.airforce/#/union/member).

This includes `ve(3,3)` mechanics and NFT governance
locking, protocol fees and external voting rewards (popularized as _bribes_)
for liquidity provider incentives, and finally, a passive staking service
(popularized as _Convex_ layer) for a more liquid way to maximize holder returns.

Where possible, we did use available open-sourced work, for which we are
grateful and lucky to be _standing on the shoulders of such giants_.

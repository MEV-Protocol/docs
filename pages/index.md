# About

Velodrome Finance is the trading and liquidity marketplace on
[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/).

  Before using Velodrome Finance, you are required to read and agree to our
  [legal disclaimer](/legal).
</Callout>

As an AMM (automated market maker) adapted from Solidly, Velodrome Finance
comes with standard features popularized by Uniswap, and some novel ones,
critical to Optimism's ecosystem development:
 * a trading fee of only 0.02%
 * near zero slippage on uncorrelated or tightly correlated digital
   assets
 * route trades through stable and volatile asset pairs
 * no-upkeep, flashloan-proof, 30 minute time-weighted average price
   (TWAP) with direct quoting support

## How is this different from other protocols?

Velodrome Finance is inspired by and incorporates elements of
the protocols such as [Solidly](https://github.com/solidlyexchange),
[Curve](https://curve.fi/rootfaq), [Votium](https://votium.app).

Where possible, the team used available open-sourced work, for which we are
grateful and lucky to be _standing on the shoulders of such giants_.

You can learn in depth about all the protocol aspects in the
[Tokenomics](/tokenomics) section.

### ve(3,3) Tokenomics

The protocol has a native token (`$VELO`) with weekly emissions distributed to
liquidity providers. The native token can be locked in exchange for a
vote-escrow (`$veVELO`) NFT (non fungible token). Holders of `$veVELO` have voting power
over what liquidity pools receive the weekly emissions. Voters receive the
trading fees and external rewards (also known as _bribes_) collected from the
liquidity pools they vote for, as well as an anti-dilutive `$veVELO` _rebase_.

### NFT Governance

By using an NFT to certify ownership of the locked tokens, the
protocol allows voting power to be traded on the open market.
This opens up benefits for our long-term lockers.

### Bribes!

The protocol allows anyone to incentivize voting for a preferred liquidity pool
by offering rewards. These rewards are deposited on a weekly basis and are
distributed to the voters proportionally to the voting power allocated to the
pool receiving the bribes.

## Who is behind this project?

The team behind Velodrome Finance previously launched
[VeDAO](https://twitter.com/_vedao_), an initiative incubated by [IT
DAO](https://informationtoken.io). veDAO's founding mandate was to engage with
the Solidly ecosystem, a protocol launched on the Fantom network by Andre
Cronje and his team, while driving long-term value to the VeDAO community.

The VeDAO team has since developed deep subject matter expertise on both
Solidly and `ve(3,3)` mechanisms, becoming the go-to resource for protocols and
chains seeking support around these topics.

By the numbers, VeDAO, managed to attract $2.6B in TVL (total value locked) in the early days,
securing ~10% of Solidly voting power and ~$1.1M USDC in treasury assets.

## What is our mission?

Our mission is to make Velodrome Finance the liquidity base layer of the
Optimism ecosystem.

# About

Velodrome Finance is an open, secure and decentralized exchange on
[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) L2 blockchain.

## Who is behind this project?

The team behind Velodrome Finance previously launched VeDAO, a community
initiative with the purpose to build upon and help the community understand
and benefit from the revolutionary Solidly protocol.

## What is our mission?

Our mission is to provide transparent and sustainable finance tools for the
Optimism eco-system, including, but not limited to the already mentioned
decentralized exchange.

## How is this different from the alternatives?

Solidly is a set of smart contracts written and open-sourced by Andre Cronje
and his team. It was launched on Fantom blockchain in February 2022.

Velodrome Finance as a product, is inspired and built upon the good parts of
the protocols like Solidly, Curve, Convex and Votium.

TODO: Explain what other features we have.

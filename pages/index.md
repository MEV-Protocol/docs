## ve(3,3) Tokenomics

Velodrome's native token is `$VELO`. Liquidity providers receive `$VELO` emissions distributed weekly. Holders of `$VELO` can vote-escrow their tokens in exchange for `$veVELO`. `$veVELO` represents voting power to direct emissions to the holder's preferred liquidity pools. In return for their participation, `$veVELO` voters receive the fees and bribes collected through the pools they vote for, as well as a `$veVELO` rebase reducing dilution.  

See additional details in Tokenomics.

## Bribes!

Velodrome has a built-in bribe function that allows anyone to incentivize voting for their preferred token pair by directing incentive payments to any available pool, which then becomes a voting reward. Bribes are released on a weekly basis for votes cast during that week. They are distributed proportionally to voters.

## Who is behind this project?

The team behind Velodrome Finance previously launched
[VeDAO](https://twitter.com/_vedao_), an initiative from [IT
DAO](https://informationtoken.io), with the mission to support the Solidly
ecosystem, a protocol launched on Fantom by Andre Cronje and his team, while
driving long-term value to the VeDAO community.

The VeDAO team has since developed deep subject matter expertise on both
Solidly and `ve(3,3)` mechanisms, becoming the go-to resource for protocols and
chains seeking support around these topics.

By the numbers, VeDAO, managed to attract $2.6B in TVL in the early days, securing
~10% of the Solidly voting power and ~$1.1M USDC in its treasury.

## What is our mission?

Our mission is to make Velodrome Finance a public good and the liquidity base
layer of the Optimism ecosystem.

## How is this different from other protocols?

Velodrome Finance as a product, is inspired and built upon the good parts of
the protocols like [Solidly](https://github.com/solidlyexchange),
[Curve](https://curve.fi/rootfaq), [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com),
[Votium](https://votium.app) and [Llama
Airforce Union](https://llama.airforce/#/union/member).

This includes `ve(3,3)` mechanics, NFT governance
locking, protocol fees and external voting rewards (popularized as _bribes_)
for liquidity provider incentives, and finally, a passive staking service
(popularized as _Convex_ layer) for a more liquid way to maximize holder returns.

Where possible, the team used available open-sourced work, for which we are
grateful and lucky to be _standing on the shoulders of such giants_.

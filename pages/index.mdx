Velocimeter, is a Decentralized Exchange on the Fantom, Base, Canto, and Mantle blockchains.
Each instance of Velocimeter is not fungible with the others. For example, on Base, the token is `$BVM`, and on Fantom it is `$FVM`. They are subject to different values and uses.

All instances can be accessed via the protocol supported site at [https://www.velocimeter.xyz/](https://www.velocimeter.xyz/).

Velocimeter dex allows users to do the following:
* swap tokens

## Where does this project come from?

Velocimeter is a project built based on the original designs of [Andre Cronje's Solidly](https://andrecronje.medium.com/ve-3-3-44466eaa088b) which was later revised and made wildly successful by [Velodrome Finance](https://app.velodrome.finance/).

## WTF is a velocimeter?

[Velocimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocimetry) is the measurement of the velocity of fluids. A velocimeter is a tool that is used to measure fluid dynamics. We felt this is analogous to what is happening in our AMM & gauges; "Liquidity" is added, moved around, and "flows" in and out of it.

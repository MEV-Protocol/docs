# Exploring Options with oFVM
oFVM is a new options token that helps to reduce sell pressure on the native FVM token. It is earned by liquidity providers (LPs) who provide liquidity to the FVM-FTM pool. oFVM can be redeemed for FVM at a discount, or it can be locked up for a period of time in order to earn veFVM. veFVM is a governance token that allows holders to vote on the distribution of emissions.

There are three main options for LPs who earn oFVM:
 - FVM-FTM LP Lock Option: This option allows LPs to lock their oFVM rewards for a period of time. During this time, the oFVM rewards will be compounded back into the FVM-FTM pool, earning the LP additional FVM and FTM.
 - veFVM Option: This option allows LPs to redeem their oFVM rewards for veFVM. veFVM is a governance token that allows holders to vote on the distribution of emissions.
 - FVM Option: This option allows LPs to sell their oFVM rewards for FVM at a discount. This option allows LPs to take advantage of the discount on FVM and sell their oFVM rewards for a profit.

## Benefits of oFVM
The introduction of oFVM has a number of benefits, including:
Reduced sell pressure: oFVM can be redeemed for FVM at a discount, which reduces the sell pressure on the native FVM token.
Increased liquidity: The FVM-FTM pool will be more liquid as a result of oFVM, as LPs will be incentivized to lock their oFVM rewards in the pool.
More sustainable APRs: The FVM-FTM pool will be able to offer more sustainable APRs as a result of oFVM, as the pool will be more liquid and there will be less sell pressure on the native FVM token.

## Conclusion
The introduction of oFVM is a positive development for the FVM ecosystem. oFVM has the potential to reduce sell pressure on the native FVM token, increase liquidity in the FVM-FTM pool, and offer more sustainable APRs for retail & protocols.
